# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed: source containment was enforced on the unresolved path, so a symlink inside
  the working directory — or a symlinked parent — could make whatbroke read and print
  a file from anywhere on disk. Both sides are now canonicalised, which also fixes a
  working directory reached through a link rejecting its own files.
- Source reads are now bounded before allocation: size is read from the descriptor
  and files over 2 MiB are skipped.
- Long source lines are narrowed for display only, by a window that follows the
  reported column, so the caret marks the offending code instead of sitting thousands
  of spaces past it. Staleness is still compared against the whole line: clipping
  first would report an edit past the cut as no edit at all.
- Only regular files are read, opened non-blocking, so a directory, device or FIFO
  named in a log can no longer stall the run.

- Fixed: standalone javac diagnostics route to the JVM parser, and Gradle compiler warnings are excluded from failures.
- Fixed: .NET diagnostics no longer require a restore banner; mypy detection preserves `.py` and `.pyi` diagnostics with optional columns and no summary.
- Fixed: `--no-source` retains statements captured in the log without reading source files.
- Fixed: signal exit codes use the platform's signal numbers, including exit code 137 for `SIGKILL`.
- Fixed: Node assertion boilerplate could group unrelated numeric failures as one likely cause.
- Fixed: nested Node test suites emitted duplicate parent failures alongside their failing tests.
- Group failures that share a likely cause, and lead with the number of causes
  rather than the number of failures. Deterministic fingerprinting, no model.
- Report `clusters` in `--json` as a partition of `failures`, which is unchanged.
- Added `--no-cluster`.
- The GitHub job summary and the run's notice line now lead with likely causes
  instead of listing every failure flat. Annotations are unchanged: one per failure.
- Fixed: annotation messages escaped `:` as `%3A`, which the runner does not decode
  in a message body, so `KeyError: 'exp'` displayed as `KeyError%3A 'exp'`.
- Fixed: pytest `-q` totals were missed, so a run reporting "85 failed" was
  summarised as a count of parsed blocks.
- Fixed: a single very long boilerplate line (pytest listing every fixture) was
  printed in full.
